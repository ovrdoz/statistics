The main purpose of it is to collect elasticsearch metrics and store in a database in postgreSql.

For local execution of this project you have as a prerequisite to have installed at least python 2.7 and install the dependencies according to the orientation file inside the /pypi directory.

With the dependencies overcome to run local, just execute the following command inside the path /app

```bash
./start
```
Ready, if you have no error just access http://<host>:5000

In the near future, describe how to build and use this project via docker, as well as call each api contained therein ....
